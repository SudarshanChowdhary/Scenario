				<p>You're used to starting your day using different tools to review important information such as Bullet*News, training
					assignments, and emerging issues. With Dashboard in iLog 10, you receive the same information and more all in one place.
					</p>
				<p>In the interaction below, you learn about Dashboard in iLog 10. Click each labeled section of the interface, and then
					hover your pointer over sections highlighted in orange. As you review each section, use the navigation buttons below
					the interface to explore different parts of the section. After you complete a section of the interface, a green checkmark
					appears. Each section of the interface must have a green checkmark before you can continue. You can start with any section
					in the interaction.</p>
